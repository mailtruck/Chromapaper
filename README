I'm going to say it right now: this code is awful.

This is honestly how I learned JavaScript. I had some knowledge prior - I know quite a bit of PHP, a little bit of Python and C++, and various markup languages - but this was my first serious encounter with JS, and it shows. There's lots of awful hacky bits and such in there.

But, if you're insane enough to want to try to help make improvements, feel free. I can answer any questions you might have about the code at thomas@mream.net.
