		<h2>Why "Syncing error 400" happens</h2>
		
		<p>Instapaper Offline downloads the text versions of your saved pages, which are provided by Instapaper. Instapaper has a limit on how many downloads can be made within a certain time, however. The limit varies based on how many articles you've downloaded recently (within the last hour or so).</p>
		<p>Unless you're doing really heavy reading (and, hey, good for you if you are :D), this should only happen on your inital sync. The best advice I can give is to keep your Instapaper bookmarks well-culled ;)</p>
		<p>For now, the most I can do is tell you to refresh in a bit. However, Instapaper will soon (in January) add an API for Reading articles, which may not have a connection limit, or one that is at least much shorter. Also, when full page support is added, this will be irrelevant, since downloads will not be going through Instapaper.</p>
