		<h2>Why "Syncing error 400" happens</h2>
		
		<p>Chromapaper downloads the text versions of your saved pages, which are provided by Instapaper. Instapaper has a limit on how many downloads of these pages can be made within a certain time, however. The limit varies based on how many articles you've downloaded recently (within the last hour or so). If the app reaches this limit, Instapaper will send back an error and refuse to allow it to download further articles for a varying length of time (usually between one to five minutes.</p>
		<p>If you see this error, it doesn't mean syncing has failed entirely, as the app will save all the articles downloaded before the limit was reached. If you come back in several minutes, you should be able to continue and finish your sync.</p>
		<p>Unless you're doing really heavy reading (and, hey, good for you if you are :D), this should only happen on your inital sync. The best advice I can give is to keep your Instapaper bookmarks well-culled.</p>
		<p>I know this bug is annoying, and I am attempting to keep it from happening, but it will take a bit of time to impliment. In the meantime, apologies for the inconvinence.</p>
